# OPTIC: Optical Particle TrackIng and Calibration

A high-performance, differentiable simulation framework to simulate optical particle detectors. This project enables gradient-based optimization of calibration parameters and particle reconstruction using automatic differentiation.

### Details on the software structure and tutorial notebooks will be added soon.
